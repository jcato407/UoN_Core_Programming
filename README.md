# UoN_Core_Programming
Python coursework completed in my first year study of Mathematical Physics (BSc) at the University of Nottingham

# Aims and Objectives
By studying the content and completing coursework for the Core Programming module, I have enhanced my knowledge of computing and have demonstrated:

    an ability to formulate algorithms to solve mathematical problems,
    an ability to implement algorithms on a computer,
    high levels of computer literacy,
    knowledge and understanding of the basic Python language and its features,
    knowledge and understanding of specialist Python packages for mathematics,
    understanding of appropriate use of computing to support mathematical study e.g. through visualisation of a function or geometric objects, or verification of a calculation,
    effective use of IT tools for processing and presenting information.
# Syllabus
The following topics were covered in the module:

    Algorithms and Logic
    Introduction to Programming and the development process
    Introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks
    The basics of the Python Language: variables, types, control structures, input and output
    Some useful modules: math
    Basic plotting of functions
    More advanced features of the Python language: Errors and Exceptions, Generators etc.
    Numpy: vectors and matrices 
    Advanced Graph Plotting
    Introduction to specialised packages for matematics in Python: numpy, scipy, sympy etc.
